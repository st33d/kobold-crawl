=== TODO_LIST

Quaid - if you examine the doubters, then choose right, it tells me I run to the left.

Custard - "Run Past" says ($80) instead of (%80).

There was at least one room that told me I had an 80% chance, but the roll said 71/75 (instead of 71/80).

There was at least one room that says an option has a % chance, but then doesn't show me a roll result.

Add some treasures to the rooms.

Make restarting show only unvisited rooms from last run
	separate index getting from room picking
	change visited to count visits
